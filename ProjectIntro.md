<h1>"Bucket List"</h1>
<h3>a wishlist of travel destinations</h3>


The Bucket List application will allow users to generate a list if places where they want to travel. 

The application will ask users to enter places through a user input field, and then add those places to list of destinations.

Within the input field, the application will use an external tool, Algolio, https://community.algolia.com/, to auto-populate locations as the user inputs the text.
(For example, if the user enters "New", then the options of New York City, New Orleans, Newark, etc will automatically show in the dropdown field as options for the user to select).

After a user has traveled to a place, they can move the location to their respective "Accomplished!" list.

In addition, a video or other visual feature will display videos of favorite destinations (in carousel or other feature-rich format).  
The application will use bideo.com to present this effect. (https://rishabhp.github.io/bideo.js/)
